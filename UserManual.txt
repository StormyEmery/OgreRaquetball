			************IMPORTANT************
			
				-Gives you a multi player game that allows people from different computers to play against eachother. When this button is clicked, the machine that is going to host the game will need to click on the start server button. The machine that is going to be the client will need to look at the IP Address of the host machine, which is in the top left corner of the screen, and type it into the text box and press enter, then you will need to click start client. 

				-NOTE: If you are the client, the IP Adress you need to type in will be on the screen where the host application is. This is because each game screen displays its own IP Address, not the IP Address of the machine you are trying to connect to.

				-NOTE: If you are the client of the multiplayer session, then you will not be able to pause the game or access the menu by pressing "ESC". You can only do this on the host machine. This is to keep the communication between the host and client simpler.
				
				-If you are playing a multiplayer round and reach an endstate, such as player one or player two winning, then on the host machine, a "New Game" and "Exit" button will appear. By pressing on "New Game", you will immediatley start a new multiplayer game with the same host and client. Pressing "Exit" will close the game.

	Objective:

		Single Player:
			The objective of this mode is to play against an AI opponent. As of right now there is now win state, but hitting the wall behind the opponent gains you a point and if you let the ball slip by you, the oppenent gets a point.

		Multi Player:
			The objective of the game is for either side to get the ball to hit the other side of the wall. This results in giving them one point. The game ends once either side reaches 8 points total. This results in a popup pannel that displays a "player" one/two "wins" with options to quit or to play a new game.

			-Note: sometimes hitting the wall of the opposing player will not grant you a point. 


	Features:

		- There is a background music track that plays while you are playing the game. You can toggle it on and off in the pause menu.

		- There are sound effects that play depending on which surface the ball hits. A different sound effect plays for a collision with the walls, the goal (chrome rectangle), and the paddle. There is also a sound effect when you pause the game and when you click on buttons in the menus.

		- The ball has a flame tail particle effect on it that is always flowing in the opposite direction that the ball is moving/rotating.

		- There is a game over state, as described above, and once entered, you have the choice of starting a new game or exiting.

		- There is also a reset ball button that resets the ball to it's original position, but doesn't start a new game. 

		- The camera follows the paddle from a third person point of view.

		- There is a single player and multi player option


	Comments:
	
		The camera position makes it a little hard to know exactly where the ball is going to be sometiems. While this adds to the difficulty of the game, we would have liked to have fine tuned this a little more and maybe give the player an option to move the camera to where they want it. We would have also liked to get the networking working a little better. For example, being able to reconnect to other clients after dropping them in a single session of the game.
