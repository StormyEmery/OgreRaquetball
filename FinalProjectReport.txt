Final Project Report:

	In terms of getting the game finished by the due date, we definitely did worse than expected. It's only one day late, but I feel we could have gotten it turned in on time if a few more things had gone our way. Unfortunately we all have busy schedules and it's hard to have all three of us meet up at the same time, but we still managed to meet up enough and work enough individually to have a majority of the systems in place and working by Friday night. The toughest part of this project was getting the host and client machines to communicate together effectively and, once we had that, figuring out what all we needed to communicate between the two to have a workable multiplayer game. Luckily we had most of this working by Friday. Another thing about this project that might not have been the hardest, but was definitely one of the more time consuming aspects was replacing a lot of our Ogre TrayManager gui stuff with CEGUI. The way we had our gui structured made it really confusing when trying to replace it. But, we finally was able to figure it out and get it in by Saturday, hence the late day used. We definitely would have liked to work on this project a little more and get it more polished, but with the end of the semester coming up and final projects/midterms underway, we had to call what we were able to accomplish good enough.  

	Looking back at the time spent on this project, we can identify our successes and failures and what caused them.

	In terms of successes, we were again able to work together and individually to be able to get a networked multiplayer game working. We were able to communicate with eachother effectively about what we had worked on on our own and were able to work efficiently when we were able to work together.

	In terms of failures, we weren't able to get the entire game done by the deadline. This was caused by several factors. Mainly because we all had midterms, projects, and family commitments to manage. We also failed in getting the game completely polished, again because it's nearing the end of the semester and we are all taking courses that have big final projects. 

	Due to these failures, we have learned that everyone has busy schedules and that you shouldn't get upset or irritated at someone if they say they can't make it to a meeting or couldn't work as long as you wanted them to on certain days. Real life is hard and is something that we all still have to find out how to manage effectively.

	We all feel good about the effort and ammount of work we were able to get done for this project and hope to make awesome final projects.
